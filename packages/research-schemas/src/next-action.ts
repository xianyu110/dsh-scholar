/**
 * NextAction — structured "what to do next" guidance projected by the
 * Kernel (GUIDE-01, design §4.2 Projection API, domain-model.md §14).
 *
 * The projection is a PURE function of authoritative state (project status,
 * pending gates, jobs, budget, contracts, ideas, evidence, claims) — never a
 * UI-local list. Every action carries a stable machine `code` plus the
 * context a UI/agent needs to render it safely:
 *
 * - `state` is the action's readiness from the project's perspective:
 *   - `ready`   — this is the current next step and can be executed now;
 *   - `blocked` — the action cannot execute until the `required` gaps are
 *     filled (the gap list names the missing preconditions);
 *   - `done`    — the step is already satisfied (terminal states, steps
 *     completed earlier in the phase).
 * - `required` is `true` when all preconditions are met, otherwise the list
 *   of missing precondition codes (e.g. `['approved_contract']`).
 * - `route` is the UI tab / operation path the action maps to
 *   (`gates` | `runs` | `evidence` | `manuscript` | `budget` | `ideas` |
 *   `contracts` | `release` | `overview`).
 * - `revision` is the revision of the dependency object the action is
 *   pinned to (project revision for gate decisions, contract version for
 *   run actions, idea version for idea gates) — `null` when not applicable.
 * - `capability` is the role/permission required to perform the action
 *   (e.g. `researcher`, `pi`); absent means no extra capability beyond the
 *   project role.
 * - `blocking` marks actions that gate phase completion (pending human
 *   gates, budget exhaustion).
 * - `refs` name the concrete authoritative objects involved (gate/job/
 *   contract/idea ids).
 * - `required_by` says who must perform the action: `human` | `agent` |
 *   `runner`.
 *
 * Legacy safety: the Kernel still emits `next_actions: string[]` (labels of
 * the non-`done` actions, in projection order) so old consumers keep
 * working. A status with no mapping degrades to `code: 'unknown'` (see
 * `NEXT_ACTION_UNKNOWN_CODE`) — a read-only label, never a mutation CTA.
